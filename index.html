    <p>Every HTML document must begin with a basic declaration that identifies its type. This is a very useful measure that inform browsers beforehand, what type of document they are about to process, allowing them to adjust their processing mechanisms accordingly.

        The DTD is inserted usign a special tag (!DOCTYPE) that takes a particular form for each document type. This declaration can only be present at the begining of the document. The following example shows the DTD for an HTML5 document:</p>
   


    <h2 title="This is 2st Heading"; title="I am a tooltip ">This is a little less Important</h2>
    <p>The head section is a container for metadata about the document. This metadata can be classified in five categories according to the element used.

        The document's title: describes briefly the subject treated in the document. This is a required item and is inserted with the title element.
        Style declarations: groups style definitions used to set presentational attributes for the elements in the document. It's inserted with the style element.
        Client-side scripts: inserts programs that provide functionality and interactivity. It's declared with the script element.
        Meta statements: define custom attributes and values. They're inserted with the meta element.
        Relational information: indicates resources that are somehow related to the document. It's inserted with the link element.
    
    The following example shows the declaration of the head block of a document with some of the elements described above.</p>
    
    
    <h3 title="This is 3st Heading"; title="I am a tooltip ">This heading is even less important than the one above</h3>
        <p>In this practice, we're going to build a basic document structure, that will be useful for the development of the following practices or any other project. So, create a new file (as seen in the tutorial "How to begin") and ready your fingers.

            To begin with, we'll put in our file the first thing every HTML document should have in order to fit the standard: the DTD. As we're writing an HTML5 document, we'll use the !DOCTYPE declaration corresponding to this version.</p>

            <style>
                * {
                  box-sizing: border-box;
                }
                
                /* Create two equal columns that floats next to each other */
                .column {
                  float: left;
                  width: 50%;
                  padding: 10px;
                  height: 300px; /* Should be removed. Only for demonstration */
                }
                

                
                  <th>/**********************************</th>
                  <td>*__        __   _     _   _       *</td> 
                  
              </table>
